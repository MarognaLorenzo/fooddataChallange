To cover the transportation cost (they had to rent a van), there is a symbolic price of 2 euro per box of 24 bottles. We'll open a few bottles so you can taste it first.  Practical info:  Tuesday 23 April, from 6pm till 7pm Redingenhof 14, 3000 Leuven at the white garage door. Payment cash only in the exact amount if possible.
