The pickup is at closing time  [18hr30 (6:30pm) on weekdays, 18hr (6:00pm) on Saturday]. 
You should be there a few minutes in advance because you won't be able to enter once the shop has closed (the sliding doors won't open).
You can gather outside the shop if you are very early.
Around one to two minutes before closing time, enter the sliding doors and wait there on the left side where the shopping baskets are. (If it's bad weather, you can gather here somewhat earlier as well instead of waiting outside, just make sure that customers can still pass easily.).
Wait there until an employee signals you that you can go collect the food. On busy days, this might take a few minutes after closing time, when the remaining customers have left.
Take all freshly baked, whole breads and pastries (not the prepackaged sliced breads). Use your own bags (the breads are 'lost' for the shop, but the bags of the shop are still usable, so avoid taking them!). This can be a lot, bring lots of shopping bags!
Check all fridges for products with a yellow discount sticker/label and take them if they are expired. Always check the actual expiration date! Sometimes the yellow label is already there even if it only expires the next day instead of today. (On Saturdays: you can also take it if it expires on Sunday as the shop is closed then.).
Sometimes an employee has already collected these yellow-sticker items, they will usually be between the bread and the fresh vegetables.
Occasionally there are also pre-packaged sliced breads with such a yellow label, the same rules apply: check date!
Everything that you collected with a yellow discount label (i.e. everything except fresh whole bread and pastries) will still need to be scanned by the employees. Make it easy and quick for them: show 1 product and say how many of that product there were in total.
Please do not leave anything at the shop, take everything! If it's too much to carry, please ask for additional help via the Whatsapp group, but don't leave it behind.
If it's too much for you to consume, the one who can best place the bread in front of his/her house can take it and post it in the Facebook group or help bring everything to a HUB, eg HUB Hal5.
Note: if you were late and could not get in because the door is closed (to be avoided!!), don't bother the employees by trying to get in and just wait outside till ones that did get in have come out again and see if you can redistribute if needed (assuming you weren't the only one for that pick-up slot).","[17/12/2022] Pickups Restarted

Very kind shopkeepers that hate to throw away food. It is mainly fresh food: fruit, vegetables, and meat; but it can also be pastry, bubble tea, and butter, ... Bring a lot of bags! They also give boxes to carry the food if you want/need them.
They did a similar thing before, but the 'food savers' started demanding stuff, so they stopped. Please, be grateful for what they give and even more so when there is nothing to be saved, since it means no food got wasted.
Take everything they give and redistribute what you don't want/need yourself.
The closest hub is Hal 5 with the shared fridge and freezer, so perfect for fresh food. The fridge is across from Korst (bakery). Please keep it clean! The motto is 'give what you can, take what you need'. The food that doesn't need cooling can go on top.
